title: Patching the BIOS of a WatchGuard T70 to Remove the Password
tags: hardware-hacking ghidra
---

in the last post, we explored how to run linux on a watchguard t70.
while it's quite useable as is, the bios password is a bit of an annoyance.
so, let's patch the bios to remove the password check entirely.

## Recap

from the previous post, we already have the bios image extracted and loaded into ghidra.
we also already found the password check function, which is how we know the password in the first place.

## Removing the Password Check

looking a bit closer at the function, we can see some convenient details that make our job easier:

1. the function only has a single call site
2. the function doesn't have a return value
3. the function doesn't take any parameters
4. the function doesn't have any relevant side effects (other than showing a prompt on the screen)

that means we can simply NOP out the entire function call, and be good to go.

i found that patching and exporting with ghidra was a bit finnicky, so i just noted the pattern of bytes to patch, and used a hex editor to do the actual patching.

the modified `BdsDxe` module is then re-inserted into the bios using H2OEZE - which correctly recalculates the checksums for us.
the patched bios binary is then flashed back to the device and voila - no more password prompt!

## How You can Jailbreak Your T70

while i'd love to share the patched bios image, i can't in good conscience do that.

however, with the knowledge in these posts, you can jailbreak your own T70 - without even opening the case.
Watchguard will surely still honor the warranty - right?

1. prepare your hardware:
   1. plug in a bootable usb stick with, for example, ubuntu server 24.04
   2. connect a network cable OR a wifi adapter (i used a network cable)
   3. plug in a serial console cable and configure your terminal to 115200 8N1
2. interrupt the boot process using `<ESC>` and enter the setup utility (something we can do now that we have the password)
3. in the setup utility, set the following settings:
   1. `Boot > Boot Mode` to `UEFI` (needed for ubuntu server)
   2. `Boot > USB Boot` to `Enabled` (boot from usb)
   3. `Advanced > Chipset Configuration > Misc Configuration > BIOS Lock` to `Disabled` (allow flashing the bios)
4. save changes and reboot, you should now see grub on the serial console
5. edit the grub entry to add `console=ttyS0,115200` to the kernel command line so you can see the installer output
6. continue until you see the installer prompt, then exit to the shell via the "help" menu
7. install flashrom via `apt install flashrom`
8. dump your current bios via `flashrom -p internal -r bios.bin` (do this twice and compare hashes to be sure everything went well), then transfer to a windows computer
9. open the dumped bios in [H20EZE](https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/tool-h20eze-insyde-easy-bios-editor/33332) and extract the `BdsDxe` module as a `.ffs`
10. open the `.ffs` in a hex editor, find and replace the pattern to the function call with NOPs (refer to table below)
11. save the modified `.ffs`
12. use "replace module" in H20EZE to insert the modified `BdsDxe` module back into the bios
13. export the modified bios as a `.fd` and transfer back to the T70
14. flash the modified bios via `flashrom -p internal -w bios.patched.fd`
15. reboot and enter setup utility to verify the password prompt is gone
16. (optionall) re-enable `BIOS Lock` to prevent accidental flashing
